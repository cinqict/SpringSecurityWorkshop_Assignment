# Springboot Security Workshop by Cinq ICT

This is the vanila project with no security.

It is a simple CRUD application which keeps track of two Resources: Employees and LegoBoxsets

The API specs can be found in the following files:

```
api-employee.http
```

and

```
api-lego.http
```

Start the application via mvn
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
.
