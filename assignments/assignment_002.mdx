Assignment 002 - Path Matchers

Spring Security allows you to model your authorization at the request level.
For example, with Spring Security you can say that all pages under /admin require one authority while all other pages simply require authentication.

By default, Spring Security requires that every request be authenticated. That said, any time you use an HttpSecurity instance, itâ€™s necessary to declare your authorization rules.

There are different ways to declare the authentication:
- Ant matchers
- Regex
- Http
- more

More info see: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/authorize-http-requests.html

002 A: Ant Matchers

e.g.
```
http
    .authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -> authorize
        .requestMatchers("/resource/**").authenticated()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
    )
```

002 B: Regex Matchers
```
http
    .authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -> authorize
        .requestMatchers(RegexRequestMatcher.regexMatcher("/resource/[A-Za-z0-9]+")).authenticated()
        .anyRequest().denyAll()
    )
```

002 C: Http Method
```
http
    .authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -> authorize
        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET).permitAll()
        .anyRequest().authenticated();
    )
```

002 D: Bonus Unit tests

Use Mockmvc to mock test some endpoints with your custom security.


Start the application via mvn
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
